        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <div class="info-box stages" id="inspiration">
            <p typewriter="true">This game is created by <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U08TJ79P0G4" class="profile">DuckyBoi_XD</a> and <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07BNRCEARM" class="profile">QinCai</a> for many reasons.
            
            At the forefront of creating this game, both of us, a few of our friends would play poker during every single lunch in school. After one lunchtime poker session, QinCai told DuckyBoi that they should make a poker game on the terminal (using Python). DuckyBoi had already thought of making a poker game CLI using python, but knew that it would require complex knowledge of SSH servers and AI players, which he knew almost nothing about However, QinCai was the perfect person. QinCai told DuckyBoi how simple it is to create a server for a poker game using SSH so that people can play against each other. So he was convinced.
        
            Another major inspiration came from Hackcluck, Summer of Making. Being pretty obvious, Summer of Making motivated us to continue the project, making it better than ever, while letting us log hours to earn shells (prizes).</p>

        <h2>Credit</h2>
        <div class="info-box stages" id="credit">
        <p typewriter="true">To be clear:
        QinCai built the entire game, with some help from AI. DuckyBoi_XD assisted by testing and fixing bugs (with the use of AI) whenever something was wrong.
        
        DuckyBoi_XD made the website with all the information, with help from the AI to form and understand the JavaScript code and part of the CSS code, while also getting help from QinCai, adding some cool features and fixing my mistakes (mostly spelling and grammar).</p>
