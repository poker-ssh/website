# Poker Over SSH Website

This website is for the Poker over SSH terminal game, made by [@DuckyBoi-XD](https://github.com/DuckyBoi-XD) and [@QinCai-rui](https://github.com/QinCai-rui).

## Purpose

To have a nice place to show and explain our game, we created a website for our game to:

- Show players how to get to our game
- Help players that don't know how to play poker
- Help players rules of poker
- Show part of our story in why we made the game
- To have a nice place to share our game to the world.

## Poker Over SSH Game

This is a terminal-based game built with Python where you can play poker with other people who are online. If no one is online, you can play with AI (bots). This game runs on an SSH server hosted on [Hack Club Nest](https://hackclub.app), so if it goes down, we go down with them. :((

WARNING: This game can be potentially addicting.

## Credit

AI: helped @DuckyBoi-XD understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when he barely knew much. Also for creating typewriter functions and fixing mistakes.

## NOTE

Repo + Website code may change do to fixing spelling, grammar, and stupid mistakes.
