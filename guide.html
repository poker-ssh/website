        </div>

        <h3 class="HTP_poker">Pre-flop</h3>

        <div class="info-box stages" id="preflop">
            <p typewriter="true">This is the start of the game where everyone is given 2 cards (a hand). With these 2 cards, in the future, you would need to make the best hand out of a maximum of 5 cards using the community cards (flop, turn, river). After being dealt the hand, a betting phase occurs where everyone needs to put in money. The first person has to bet a minimum of $1, and everyone else needs to either call, raise or fold. At the end of the betting phase, everyone should have bet the same amount except for anyone who has folded.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="HTP_poker">Flop</h3>

        <div class="info-box stages" id="flop">
            <p typewriter="true">Following the Pre-Flop comes the Flop, where the dealer will reveal 3 of the 5 community cards. Then another betting phase occurs, but instead of there being a minimum bet of $1, you are given an option to check, bet or fold.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="HTP_poker">Turn</h3>

        <div class="info-box stages" id="turn">
            <p typewriter="true">Next come the Turn where the dealer will show the 4th card of the 5 community cards. Again, another betting phase occurs with the same rules as the betting phase in the flop.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="HTP_poker">River</h3>

        <div class="info-box stages" id="river">
            <p typewriter="true">Afterwards comes the River, where the dealer will show the 5th and last community card that you can make your best hand with. The last betting phase of the round occurs.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="HTP_poker">Showdown</h3>

        <div class="info-box stages" id="showdown">
            <p typewriter="true">After all the stages, the last stage is the showdown. In the showdown, everyone shows their cards, and whoever has the best hand wins the entire pot. If 2 or more people have the same hand (eg, 2 people have both King and Queen, two pair (no matter the suit), the pot will be split between the people with the same hand.</p>
